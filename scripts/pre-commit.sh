# scripts/pre-commit.sh — minimal pre-commit gate for RPL5050.
#
# Runs the cheap 5-ms sanity smoke first (so almost-everything-broken
# changes fail fast), then the full test suite if --full is given.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/pre-commit.sh           # sanity smoke only (~5 ms)
#   bash scripts/pre-commit.sh --full    # sanity + full suite
#   bash scripts/pre-commit.sh --persist # also include persist suite
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — every gate green.
#   1  — at least one gate red.  Stderr says which.
#
# Wire this in as a real git hook with:
#   ln -sf ../../scripts/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
#   chmod +x scripts/pre-commit.sh
#
# Filed against the unit-tests lane in docs/TESTS.md
# ("Next-session queue" item 5, rolled forward s070 → s074 → s075).
