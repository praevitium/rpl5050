# Release Notes — rpl.ai v0.2

**Release date:** 2026-04-26

---

## What is rpl.ai?

rpl.ai is a modern, high-resolution desktop reimplementation of the HP 50g
graphing calculator. It preserves everything that made the HP 50g exceptional
— the RPN/RPL stack model, the User-RPL programming language, and the full
AUR command surface — while replacing the original's 128×80 monochrome LCD
with a crisp, resizable UI and swapping its 1990s-era CAS for
[Giac](https://www-fourier.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/~parisse/giac.html), the
same symbolic engine Bernard Parisse (author of the HP 48/49/50g "erable" CAS)
later used in Xcas and the HP Prime.

The application runs as a native desktop window on macOS, Windows, and Linux
via [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app/). The entire calculator frontend is plain
HTML / CSS / ES modules — no build step, no framework, no bundler required for
development.

## Functionality in v0.2

### Stack engine and RPN model

The core stack is fully operational. Objects flow on and off the stack exactly
as on the physical HP 50g: Last-In-First-Out, with levels labeled L1 through
Ln. DROP, DUP, SWAP, ROT, ROLL, PICK, OVER, and the full manipulation family
are all registered. The interactive stack view supports direct drag-and-drop
level reordering.

### RPL programming language

The User-RPL interpreter supports the complete structured-programming surface:

- **Control flow:** `IF / THEN / ELSE / END`, `WHILE / REPEAT / END`,
  `DO / UNTIL / END`, `FOR / NEXT / STEP`, `START / NEXT / STEP`, `CASE /
  THEN / DEFAULT / END`, `IFERR / THEN / ELSE / END`
- **Local environments:** `→ a b c « … »` binds named locals for the
  duration of a sub-program
- **Suspended execution:** `HALT` suspends a running program into a LIFO slot;
  `CONT` resumes it; `KILL` discards it. Multiple programs can be halted
  simultaneously.
- **Compiled programs:** `« … »` literals, name evaluation, and the full
  deferred-execution model

### Numeric types

All four numeric towers operate in parallel with no precision-loss surprises:

- **Real** — backed by [decimal.js](https://mikemcl.github.io/decimal.js/) at
  15 significant digits. `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3` exactly.
- **Integer** — arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic via BigInt coercion
- **Complex** — backed by [complex.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/complex.js)
  with correct branch-cut handling for `pow`, `sqrt`, and the hyperbolic family
- **Rational** — backed by [Fraction.js](https://github.com/nicktindall/Fraction.js)
  with BigInt numerators; Integer ÷ Integer in EXACT mode returns a Rational
  automatically

### CAS (symbolic computation)

Giac is vendored at `www/src/vendor/giac/` as a prebuilt WebAssembly module
and runs synchronously on the main thread via a thin adapter in
`www/src/rpl/cas/`. Symbolic objects (`'expr'`) push through Giac for
`EXPAND`, `FACTOR`, `SIMPLIFY`, `SOLVE`, `DIFF`, `INTEGRATE`, `TAYLOR`,
`SERIES`, and the broader CAS function set. The no-fallback policy means a
CAS operation either succeeds via Giac or surfaces a clean error — there is no
silent degradation to a partial numeric approximation.

### HP 50g AUR command coverage

As of this release, **447 HP 50g commands are fully shipped** (✓), with an
additional handful partially implemented (~). Commands span:

- Arithmetic and scalar math (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, MOD, power, roots, logs,
  trig, hyperbolic, and their inverses)
- Comparisons and boolean (`==`, `≠`, `<`, `>`, `≤`, `≥`, `AND`, `OR`,
  `NOT`, `XOR`)
- Bitwise / BinaryInteger operations (full #hex / #oct / #bin / #dec surface)
- Angle and conversion ops (`R→D`, `D→R`, `→HMS`, `HMS→`, `→Q`, `→Qπ`,
  `→STR`, `STR→`, `OBJ→`, `→OBJ`, `→UNIT`, `UNIT→`, `UBASE`, `CONVERT`)
- Stack manipulation (DROP, DUP, SWAP, ROT, ROLL, PICK, OVER, NIP, TUCK, …)
- Type predicates and reflection (`TYPE`, `TYPEVAL`, `VARS`, `PURGE`, `NEWOB`,
  `SAME`, `RCL`, `STO`, …)
- List operations (`GET`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, `TAIL`, `SIZE`, `SORT`, `REVLIST`,
  `APPEND`, `MAKELIST`, `DOSUBS`, `DOLIST`, `MAP`, `STREAM`, …)
- String operations (`+`, `SIZE`, `POS`, `SUB`, `HEAD`, `TAIL`, `NUM`, `CHR`,
  `STR→`, `→STR`, …)
- Vector and matrix operations (full arithmetic, transposition, inverse, LU,
  QR, SVD, `RDM`, `TRN`, `DET`, `TRACE`, `CROSS`, `DOT`, element-wise apply)
- Polynomial operations (`HORNER`, `PCOEF`, `PROOT`, `PTAYL`, `QUOT`, `REMAINDER`,
  `EGCD`, `GCD`, `LCM`, `EUCLID`, `INVMOD`, …)
- CAS / symbolic ops (`EXPAND`, `FACTOR`, `SIMPLIFY`, `SOLVE`, `DIFF`,
  `INTEGRATE`, `TAYLOR`, `SERIES`, `SUBST`, `MATCH`, `QUOTE`, `EVAL`, …)
- Statistics (`MEAN`, `SDEV`, `VAR`, `CORR`, `COVA`, `LR`, `PREDV`, `PREDX`,
  `ΣX`, `ΣY`, `ΣXY`, `ΣX²`, `ΣY²`, `NΣ`, and the full ΣDAT / fit-model family)
- Control flow and program substrate (`EVAL`, `XEQ`, `HALT`, `CONT`, `KILL`,
  `WAIT`, `ABORT`, `ERROR`, `ERRN`, `ERRM`, `DOERR`, …)
- Variable and directory operations (`STO`, `RCL`, `PURGE`, `VARS`, `ALLVARS`,
  `CRDIR`, `PATH`, `HOME`, `UPDIR`, `ORDER`, …)
- Display and UI ops reachable from RPL (`DISP`, `MSGBOX`, `INPUT`, `PROMPT`,
  `BEEP`, `FREEZE`, `CLLCD`, …)

### Data-type width

Every shipped command has been audited for consistent behavior across the full
type matrix: Real, Integer, Complex, Rational, BinaryInteger, String, Name,
List, Vector, Matrix, Unit, Tagged, Program, Symbolic. The `docs/DATA_TYPES.md`
ledger tracks the exact widening rules — Tagged transparency, List distribution,
Symbolic lift, Vector/Matrix broadcast, Unit propagation, and BinaryInteger
coercion — for each op.

### Persistence

`persist.js` serializes and deserializes the full stack and home directory to
local storage across sessions, including all value types. State is restored
automatically on launch.

### Desktop shell

The Tauri 2 window provides native menus, a resizable 600×900 default
footprint, and platform-native installers (`.dmg` on macOS, `.msi` on
Windows, `.deb` / `.AppImage` on Linux). The frontend also runs as a static
web page (`www/index.html`) for browser-based use without the Tauri wrapper.

### AI assistant (beta)

A side-panel chat interface connects to an LLM via `www/src/ai/` to answer
questions about RPL programming, explain stack operations, and help debug
programs. This feature is experimental and requires a separate model download.

### Test suite

5,666 assertions across 18 test files, all passing. Tests are plain Node ES
modules — no test framework, no mocking layer — and cover the parser,
evaluator, stack operations, numerics, matrices, types, lists, units,
statistics, persistence, reflection, and UI entry logic.

## Known limitations in v0.2

### Commands not yet implemented

Approximately 90 HP 50g AUR commands remain unregistered. The most notable
gaps are:

- **Matrix decompositions:** `CHARPOL`, `EGVL`, `EGV`, `JORDAN`, `SCHUR`
  (characteristic polynomial, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, Jordan/Schur forms).
  LU, QR, and SVD are fully shipped.
- **Modular polynomial ops:** `POLYEVAL`, `MULTMOD` — these depend on a
  persistent `MODULO` state slot not yet introduced.
- **CAS special functions:** `Ei`, `Si`, `Ci` (exponential/sine/cosine integrals).
- **Reflection:** `TVARS` (type-filtered sibling of `VARS`).
- **Control-theory:** `ACKER`, `CTRB`, `OBSV`.
- **Groebner CAS ops:** `GREDUCE`, `GXROOT`, `SRPLY`.

### Explicitly out of scope (will-not-support)

The following HP 50g subsystems are deliberately excluded from this
reimplementation. They either require hardware-specific state, depend on
legacy binary library formats, or are superseded by better modern equivalents:

`USER` mode, `ENTRY` mode, `S.SLV` solver app, `NUM.SLV` numeric solver app,
`FINANCE` app, `TIME` (hardware clock), `DEF` (algebraic-mode definition),
`LIB` / `LIBS` / `ATTACH` / `DETACH` (HP binary library system), `OFF`.

### Graphics / plotting

`BARPLOT`, `HISTPLOT`, `SCATRPLOT`, `FUNCTION`, `POLAR`, `PARAMETRIC`, and
`DIFFEQ` plot modes are not yet implemented. The ΣDAT matrix and fit-model
state are fully functional — plots are the remaining UI surface.

### Suspended execution — named sub-programs

`HALT` inside a named sub-program invoked via a variable (the
`_evalValueSync` path) rejects cleanly but does not suspend. The generator
protocol needs threading through the synchronous Name-eval call to fully
close this.

### Step debugger

`DBUG`, `SST`, `SST↓` are registered as stubs. They need a UI surface
(step-mode indicator, single-step button) to be useful.

### CAS runs on the main thread

Giac executes synchronously on the main thread. Long `FACTOR` or `SOLVE` calls
will block the UI until they complete. Moving Giac to a Web Worker would fix
this but requires reintroducing async plumbing the op layer currently avoids.

### No mobile layout

The keypad assumes desktop aspect ratios. The calculator is not optimized for
phone or tablet viewports.

## Possible future enhancements

The items below are drawn directly from `docs/ROADMAP.md`. They represent
the clearest paths forward after v0.2.0, roughly in priority order.

**Close the command gap.** Matrix eigensolvers (`EGVL`, `EGV`) and the
`CHARPOL` characteristic-polynomial op are the highest-value remaining holes
in the linear-algebra surface. The `MODULO` state slot prerequisite for
modular polynomial ops is small and self-contained.

**Graphics output.** Add a graphics display mode (SVG/canvas subview) and
wire `BARPLOT`, `HISTPLOT`, `SCATRPLOT` off the existing ΣDAT matrix. Follow
up with `FUNCTION`, `POLAR`, `PARAMETRIC`, and `DIFFEQ` plot types driven by
sampled evaluation of user-supplied Programs or Symbolics.

**Persistence and portability.** Named stack snapshots (save/restore the
whole stack + home directory under a label, HP50 "backup ports" equivalent).
Import/export of RPL programs as plain text with robust `« … »` round-trip
parsing. A session-scoped error log (ring buffer of last N RPLErrors) for
debugging scripted programs.

**RPL interpreter — finish the suspended-execution story.** Thread the
generator protocol through the Name-eval path so `HALT` works inside named
sub-programs. Build the `DBUG` / `SST` / `SST↓` step-debugger UI surface.
Add a dedicated "Program aborted" status-line flash for `ABORT`.

**Command palette.** A `/<name>` fuzzy-search overlay over the full
registered op list. The `allOps()` enumerator already exposes the registry;
this is primarily a UI feature.

**Contextual help tooltips.** Hover an op name in the stack or command line
to see its AUR signature and a one-liner description. Metadata is already in
`docs/COMMANDS.md`; a structured pass-through to tooltip copy is the
remaining work.

**Mobile layout.** Two responsive breakpoints — landscape phone and portrait
tablet — to unlock the calculator as a second-screen tool.

**Theme polish.** The existing light/dark skins are functional. A third
"LCD emulation" skin (green-on-black) is a natural nostalgia option.

**WebWorker-hosted CAS.** Move Giac off the main thread to unblock the UI
during long symbolic computations. The tradeoff is reintroducing async
plumbing the op layer currently sidesteps cleanly.

**Offline-first PWA.** Service worker + cache manifest so the calculator
runs from cache without network after the first load. Pairs naturally with
the existing Tauri desktop build.

**Collaborative sessions.** Two users sharing the same home directory over
WebSockets. All state already lives behind the `state` module — this is
primarily a synchronization and transport problem.

**"Show your work" export.** Generate a PDF or Markdown transcript of the
last N stack operations with formatted results and the entry-line keystrokes
that produced them. Useful for coursework, support threads, and reproducible
calculations.
